<p>“I enjoyed my driving lessons with Rob. I had another driving instructor before him and rob was so much better because at the end of every lesson he would give me a debrief on how it went what I need to practice next. But he never made me feel bad about my driving. So I would definitely recommend him to others.”</p>
