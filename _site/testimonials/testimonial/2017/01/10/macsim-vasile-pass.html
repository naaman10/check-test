<p>“I’m Macsim Vasile and today is 20/01/2017, and my instructor is Rob.  To be honest I recommend checkmirrors driving school to anyone because they are patient with pupils and flexible with the hours.  I have passed the test and I can’t explain how happy I am.  Thanks Rob and all the best, Max”</p>
