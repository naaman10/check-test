        <h2>What you need to Consider When Becoming a Driving Instructor</h2>
        <p>Here are some few things you will need to consider before deciding to become a driving instructor with Checkmirrors School of Motoring. After considering them please contact us and we are more than happy to meet to discuss even further and for you to talk to one of our qualified instructors.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Checkmirrors offers personal one to one tuition that is tailored to suit you. We do not send you out of area nor do we put you on block booked courses that are not flexible to meet you.</li>
          <li>We charge £28 per full hour of instruction. There are no upfront costs and you can take the lessons to suit you.</li>
          <li>There are 3 parts to the test:
            <ul>
              <li>Part 1 – theory. You will need to buy the disc and spend time on your own learning the theory. We know that if you spend time on this the chances of passing first time are increased. Out instructor can offer you some support to help you
                understand the theory. The fee to take your test as of November 2016 is £81.</li>
              <li>Part 2 – practice – This is a taught element and the fee for the test as of November 2016 is £111.</li>
              <li>Part 3 – practice – This is a taught element and the fee for the test as of November 2016 is £111.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>On average it takes 20 taught lessons to pass part 2 and 40 lessons to pass part 3.</li>
          <li>You get 3 attempts only to pass part 2 and 3.</li>
          <li>You will need to have a DBS check when you first register.</li>
          <li>You have to pay a fee to join the ADI register, get a trainee licence and renew your registration every 4 years. The fee to register is £300 and the trainees licence is £140. These are one off costs. Every 4 years you will need to pay £300 for
            re-registration.</li>
          <li>Information on fees can be found at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/approved-driving-instructor-adi-fees">gov.uk</a> </li>
          <li>Once you have got your PDI (learner licence) you can teach pupils. You will need to have a minimum of 20 taught hours before you get fully qualified.</li>
          <li>You will need insurance as an instructor. The costs will vary and depend on your car, like any other insurance. However one of our instructors pays approx £400 a year.</li>
          <li>You will need to own your own car which must be clean and in good order.</li>
          <li>You will need to have dual controls fitted. The cost will depend on your car but ranges between £300-£400.</li>
