Seb said:  "Experienced, knowledgeable, helpful and honest. I had a great instructor that helped both my wife and I pass our tests and it was well with every penny.  I don't think "thanks" is enough to convey the level of appreciation I'm feeling right now, but the contribution of tough love, honest feedback and patience was just what I needed to pass.
Thanks so much for everything. I'd recommend the company and my instructor particularly to anyone looking to learn or just refresh"
