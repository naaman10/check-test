Rob said "Just passed first time with Nick and cannot say enough good things about him. Very calm influence, great teaching style and you couldn't ask for a more qualified teacher. I would recommend Nick to anyone and I've already got my younger brother learning with him and I'm sure my younger sister will learn with him as well as a result. I felt very safe in his capable hands and credit my passing to him. Thank you Nick!"
